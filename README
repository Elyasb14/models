Models I've implemented in tinygrad:

- mnist.py: this is the most basic of all neural networks; an mnist trainer.
- better_mnist.py: this is an improved version of mnist, stolen from the tinygrad repo

TODO
- refactor mnist.py to be able to use the fashion mnist dataset
- implement inferencing in using model.safetensors inside mnist.py
- implement training and inference inside better_mnist.py
- implement alexnet
- implement a simple nlp model
