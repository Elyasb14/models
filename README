# Models implemented in tinygrad

## TODO

[ ] translate a pytorch model into tinygrad
[ ] implement some makemore models https://github.com/karpathy/makemore
[ ] make data downloaders for both mnist and fashionmnist so users don't have to save the files
[ ] train a cnn to train fashion mnist to over 95%
[ ] get some onnx model and run it

## LESSONS LEARNED

- when training fashion mnist on cnn.py, simply raising the training steps doesn't really contribute to notably better model accuracy. the loss function may get driven down a lot, but this doesn't necessarily contribute to a better model.
