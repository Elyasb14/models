# Models implemented in tinygrad

## MODELS

- mlp.py: the most basic of all nns, an mlp. this trains mnist to around 93%, and fashion mnist to about 80%. it consists of 2 linear layers with a leakyrelu in between them. 

## TODO

[ ] implement some makemore models <https://github.com/karpathy/makemore>
[ ] get some onnx model and run it
[ ] make data downloaders for both mnist and fashionmnist so users don't have to save the files

## LESSONS LEARNED

- when training fashion mnist on cnn.py, simply raising the training steps doesn't really contribute to notably better model accuracy. the loss function may get driven down a lot, but this doesn't necessarily contribute to a better model.
